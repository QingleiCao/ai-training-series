# SmartSim at OLCF

While HPC support for AI has grown quickly over the past few years, AI support for HPC has not. Integrating Machine Learning into HPC simulations represents a challenging engineering task. SmartSim was created to ease this burden on scientists.

SmartSim is a workflow library that makes it easier to use common Machine Learning (ML) libraries, like PyTorch and TensorFlow, in High Performance Computing (HPC) simulations and applications. This allows the launching of ML infrastructure on HPC systems alongside user workloads. SmartSim also allows ML to be written in Python, while still interfacing with Fortran, C, and C++ applications at HPC scale.
